## Problem 1

Create a city_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”), and a binary
variable indicating whether the homicide is solved. Omit cities Dallas,
TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO – these don’t report victim race.
Also omit Tulsa, AL – this is a data entry mistake. For this problem,
limit your analysis those for whom victim_race is white or black. Be
sure that victim_age is numeric.

``` r
homicide_data = 
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv") |>
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    resolved = as.numeric(disposition == "Closed by arrest"),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
    victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "White")) |> 
  filter(
    !city_state %in% 
      c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL")) |>
  filter(victim_race %in% c("White", "Black"))
```

For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the glm function to fit a logistic
regression with resolved vs unresolved as the outcome and victim age,
sex and race as predictors. Save the output of glm as an R object; apply
the broom::tidy to this object; and obtain the estimate and confidence
interval of the adjusted odds ratio for solving homicides comparing male
victims to female victims keeping all other variables fixed.

``` r
baltimore_df =
  homicide_data |>
  filter(city == "Baltimore")

fit_logistic = 
  baltimore_df |> 
  glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = _, family = binomial()) 

tidy_fit =
  fit_logistic |> 
  broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE) |> 
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    OR_low = exp(conf.low),
    OR_high = exp(conf.high)
  )

# Extract OR comparing male vs female victims
male_OR =
  tidy_fit |>
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") |>
  select(term, OR, OR_low, OR_high)

male_OR
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 4
    ##   term              OR OR_low OR_high
    ##   <chr>          <dbl>  <dbl>   <dbl>
    ## 1 victim_sexMale 0.426  0.324   0.558

Now run glm for each of the cities in your dataset, and extract the
adjusted odds ratio (and CI) for solving homicides comparing male
victims to female victims. Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use
of purrr::map, list columns, and unnest as necessary to create a
dataframe with estimated ORs and CIs for each city.

``` r
city_OR =
  homicide_data |>
  nest(data = -city) |>
  mutate(
    fit = map(data, ~ glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex,
                          data = .x, family = binomial())),
    tidy = map(fit, ~ broom::tidy(.x, conf.int = TRUE)),
    tidy = map(tidy, ~ 
                 .x |>
                   mutate(
                     OR = exp(estimate),
                     OR_low = exp(conf.low),
                     OR_high = exp(conf.high)
                   ) |>
                   filter(term == "victim_sexMale") |>
                   select(term, OR, OR_low, OR_high)
              )
  ) |>
  select(city, tidy) |>
  unnest(tidy)
```

    ## Warning: There were 44 warnings in `mutate()`.
    ## The first warning was:
    ## ℹ In argument: `tidy = map(fit, ~broom::tidy(.x, conf.int = TRUE))`.
    ## Caused by warning:
    ## ! glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred
    ## ℹ Run `dplyr::last_dplyr_warnings()` to see the 43 remaining warnings.

Create a plot that shows the estimated ORs and CIs for each city.
Organize cities according to estimated OR, and comment on the plot.

``` r
city_OR |>
  mutate(city = fct_reorder(city, OR)) |>        # reorder by OR
  ggplot(aes(x = OR, y = city)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = OR_low, xmax = OR_high), height = 0.2) +
  labs(
    title = "Adjusted Odds Ratio (Male vs Female Victims) for Homicide Resolution",
    x = "Odds Ratio (Male vs Female)",
    y = "City"
    )
```
