## Problem 1

``` r
homicide_data = read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  drop_na()
```

    ## Rows: 52179 Columns: 12
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (9): uid, victim_last, victim_first, victim_race, victim_age, victim_sex...
    ## dbl (3): reported_date, lat, lon
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Create a city_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”), and a binary
variable indicating whether the homicide is solved. Omit cities Dallas,
TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO – these don’t report victim race.
Also omit Tulsa, AL – this is a data entry mistake. For this problem,
limit your analysis those for whom victim_race is white or black. Be
sure that victim_age is numeric.

``` r
homicide_data = 
  homicide_data |>
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    # 1 = solved, 0 = unsolved
    solved = if_else(disposition == "Closed by arrest", 1, 0),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)) |> 
  filter(
    !city_state %in% 
      c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL")) |>
  filter(victim_race %in% c("White", "Black"))
```

    ## ℹ In argument: `victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)`.

For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the glm function to fit a logistic
regression with resolved vs unresolved as the outcome and victim age,
sex and race as predictors. Save the output of glm as an R object; apply
the broom::tidy to this object; and obtain the estimate and confidence
interval of the adjusted odds ratio for solving homicides comparing male
victims to female victims keeping all other variables fixed.

Now run glm for each of the cities in your dataset, and extract the
adjusted odds ratio (and CI) for solving homicides comparing male
victims to female victims. Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use
of purrr::map, list columns, and unnest as necessary to create a
dataframe with estimated ORs and CIs for each city.

Create a plot that shows the estimated ORs and CIs for each city.
Organize cities according to estimated OR, and comment on the plot.
